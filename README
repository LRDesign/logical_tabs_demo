== Logical Tabs Demo

This is a simple, bare-bones rails application to demonstrate the usage of the logical_tabs plugin in creating a tabbed interface.  

The key files are in app/views/foos/index.html.erb  (which shows the plugin
as used with ERB and Prototype) and app/views/bars/index.html.haml (which shows the plugin as used with HAML and jQuery).

For more info, see the logical_tabs plugin:
